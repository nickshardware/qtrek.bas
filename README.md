# Gaming in QBasic

While throwing away some old stuff,
I found these floppy disks
containing some old code in QBasic and Pascal.
I did not recognize any of these files,
but they had my name in them,
so they must have been written
by the 15-year-old me
in the late nineties.

An interesting is this one:
a Star Trek themed game written in QBasic
with all the sins a programmer could ever commit.

Please note that Star Trek is a trademark of Paramount pictures
whereas QBasic belongs to Microsoft.
