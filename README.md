While throwing away some old stuff,
I found these floppy disks
containing some old code in QBasic and Pascal.
I did not recognize any of these files,
but they had my name in them,
so they must have been written
by the 15-year-old me
in the late nineties.

An interesting is this one:
a Star Trek themed game written in QBasic
with all the sins a programmer could ever commit.

I did the graphics with another program written in
QBasic, an editor that let's you put pixels and
change their colour.
I may publish that one as well some day.

## To do

The game is in German,
as well as many of the variable and function names.
This is not good.
Also, this is not really a game yet, it runs infinitely.
You just shoot space ships and collect points in the process.

## Legal stuff

Please note that Star Trek is a trademark of Paramount pictures
whereas QBasic belongs to Microsoft.
